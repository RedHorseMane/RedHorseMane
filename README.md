# Hi there, I'm Brady 👋

I’m a curious maker, author, and lifelong learner currently exploring the world of **Python** and **web development**. My journey into programming started with a desire to build tools that support **electronics prototyping** and creative projects — and I’m learning one step at a time.

---

## 🚀 **Currently Learning**
- **Python** fundamentals (CS50P, MIT, books and various other online resources).
- **Web development with Django** (CS50W and tutorials from Will Vincent (wsvincent), Eric Matthes (ehmatthes) & Djangoproject.com).
- Building small projects and experimenting with electronics-related tools.

---

## 🌱 **My Goals**
- Develop a few simple Django apps to deepen my understanding of web frameworks.
- Create programs that help with electronics prototyping and 3D printing.
- Share my progress and projects here as I grow.

---

## 🛠 **Tech & Tools I'm Using**
- **Languages:** Python (beginner)  
- **Web:** Django (exploring), HTML, CSS  
- **Tools:** VS Code, Vim, Git, GitHub, PythonAnywhere  
- **Other interests:** 3D printing, electronics design, and writing.

## ✍ **More About Me**
When I’m not coding, I write novels (including *The Adventures of William Woodpecker*) and work on **3D-printed enclosures** and **guitar effects prototyping** via my small brand [Sonciel](https://sonciel.com).
